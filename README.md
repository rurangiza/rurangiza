Hi there! I'm Arsène. I'm a software engineer student based in Belgium. 

#### Currently

Together with 3 mates, we're building [Transcendance](https://github.com/jsilance/ft_transcendence).
A modern version of the classic game **Pong** 🏓 in the form of a web application. The game will be multiplayer, with a match making system, a scoreboard, user accounts and stats, and a chat functionality.
